## Legal-and-Ethical-Framework-Analysis
This project presents a comprehensive analysis and documentation package focused on enhancing the cybersecurity posture of The University of Texas Health Science Center. The deliverables encompass legal and ethical evaluations, a tailored security policy, a structured incident response plan, and a detailed business impact analysis (BIA). These components collectively support proactive risk management and compliance with industry standards.

# Objectives
- Legal and Ethical Framework:
A thorough review of applicable cybersecurity laws, ethical considerations, and federal/state compliance regulations that affect academic medical institutions, including HIPAA, FERPA, and HITECH.

- Security Policy Development:
Creation of a formal security policy tailored for a health science academic environment. This policy addresses acceptable use, data classification, access control, password management, and more—aligned with NIST and ISO/IEC 27001 standards.

- Incident Response Plan (IRP):
A practical and step-by-step guide to preparing for, detecting, responding to, and recovering from cyber incidents. It outlines roles, communication procedures, containment strategies, and post-incident review processes.

- Business Impact Analysis (BIA):
Identification and prioritization of critical assets, potential threats, and impacts of system disruptions. This BIA supports informed decision-making regarding continuity planning and resource allocation.
